# AI Chatbot

## Introduction

The **AI Chatbot** is a simple web-based application that leverages AI to interact with users. This chatbot can process natural language input and generate meaningful responses, offering an engaging user experience. This project demonstrates the integration of **front-end** and **back-end** technologies, specifically combining **HTML, CSS, JavaScript** for the user interface, and **Python with Flask** for the backend services.

## Features

- **Interactive Chat Interface**: A clean and intuitive user interface for seamless communication with the chatbot.
- **Dynamic Responses**: The chatbot generates real-time AI-powered responses based on user input.
- **Customizable Backend**: Built with Flask, you can easily modify the backend to adjust the AI model or logic used for generating responses.
- **Cross-platform Compatibility**: Works on any modern browser (Chrome, Firefox, Edge, etc.).

## Technology Stack

- **Frontend**: 
  - **HTML** for the structure of the page
  - **CSS** for styling
  - **JavaScript** for dynamic interactions with the chatbot

- **Backend**: 
  - **Python** (Flask) to handle API requests and integrate with the AI model

- **Optional**: Node.js (for other future features like additional integrations, live data, etc.)

## Getting Started

Follow these steps to set up and use the AI Chatbot locally.

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have the following installed:

- **Python 3.8+**
- **Node.js** (optional, if you plan on adding more JavaScript functionality)
- A modern **web browser** (e.g., Chrome, Firefox, Edge)
  
### Installation

#### Clone the Repository

Start by cloning the project repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/AI-GenZ/ai-chatbot.git
cd ai-chatbot
```

#### Setup the Backend

1. Ensure the Python backend file (`server.py`) is located in the root directory of the project.

2. Install the required Python dependencies:

   ```bash
   pip install flask
   ```

3. Start the backend server:

   ```bash
   python server.py
   ```

   The server will start running locally on `http://localhost:5000`.

#### Setup the Frontend

1. Open the **`index.html`** file in your preferred web browser.

2. This will launch the chatbot interface. The frontend communicates with the backend to generate AI-powered responses.

## How to Use

1. Open the **`index.html`** file in your web browser by double-clicking it (or opening it via your preferred editor).
2. In the input box, type a message or question and press **Send**.
3. The chatbot will process your input and display its response below the message input box.
4. Continue the conversation by typing in the input box again.
